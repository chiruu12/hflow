"""Stage-run semantics: one owner for what every execution backend must do.

The generated Airflow sub-DAGs (``hflow.runtime._templates``) are thin
callers into this module, so the batch/online lane planning, the pipeline
loading contract, the per-episode accounting loop, and the error/quarantine
budgets live in the library rather than inside generated code strings. Any
other backend that runs the pipeline -- a hosted executor, a different
scheduler, a plain script -- reuses these functions instead of
re-implementing semantics by copying template text. (Bundles pin
``hflow==<renderer's version>``, so a rendered DAG and the library it calls
can never skew.)

Budget semantics (the mass-failure gates): a run tolerates up to
``max(8, ceil(1% of total))`` failures of a kind; checks decide quarantine,
so the quarantine budget applies only in the meta stage, and a run where
EVERY episode errored always fails regardless of budget.

    The no-scheduler backend: the same per-episode accounting and the same
    mass-failure budgets the generated DAGs apply, minus the scheduler. Nobody
    should reimplement the loop, which is why this lives beside
    :func:`process_stage_batch` rather than in the CLI -- a hand-rolled
    ``for uri in uris: app.process(uri)`` silently drops the budgets, and a
    run that quarantined half its input would then report success.

    Lane planning is deliberately absent. Bin-packing and staggered starts
    exist to spread work over workers that run concurrently; here there is one
    process, so every episode is one batch and a stagger would be pure delay.

    Stages run in stage-graph order (sync, then meta, then labels, then
    media), and each stage's gate applies before the next begins -- so a
    corpus that fails the error budget in ``sync`` never spends an ffmpeg
    decode pass on ``meta``. The budgets themselves are per-stage exactly as
    in the sub-DAGs: the quarantine budget only in ``meta``, because checks
    are what decide quarantine.

    Under the default :attr:`StageSelection.OUTSTANDING`, every stage after
    ``sync`` runs on only the episodes whose steps the catalog does not already
    record as settled at their current versions -- so re-ingesting an unchanged
    corpus costs one source hash per episode instead of a decode pass and a
    contact sheet. The plan is built from what ``sync`` just recorded, which is
    why it is computed here between the stages rather than by the caller before
    them; :mod:`hflow.stage_planning` explains why the ordering is what makes
    it sound. Planning is skipped entirely when ``sync`` is not among the
    stages, because then nothing has re-established which episode each
    recording currently is, and a stale answer would skip real work.

    The per-stage budgets apply to what each stage actually ran. That is the
    honest denominator: a stage handed four outstanding episodes out of four
    hundred should fail loudly when all four error, and it does.
